This video chat exercise is a freecodecamp exercise as in https://learn.freecodecamp.org/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/p2p-video-chat-application/

The exercise fulfills all the 'user stories' listed in the requirement of the exercise.

This exercise is heavily indebted to https://github.com/Basscord/video-chat, his youtube video and code. I found his code only addresses the essence of WebRTC and took me least time to adopt. There are other ways to implement this simple exercise. WebRTC, as THE way for implementing realtime peer to peer comm, I used webrtc.
